On Thursday, November 8 I will be travelling to the Australian National Univeristy (ANU) in Canberra, Australia for the ANU Computational Biology conference, where I will be giving an oral presentation on my work detecting somatic mutations in \textit{Eucalyptus} species. 
The conference is being organized by one of my close collaborators on this work, Dr. Robert Lanfear, who has invited me to present and is paying for travel to Canberra and lodging while at the conference. However, I will be responsible for meals while at the conference. I am applying for this award to pay for meals during the 6 days I will be in Australia. As the current per-diem for Canberra is \$126, I would spend the entirety of the \$500 award.

This conference will greatly assist me in meeting my academic goals. I am a PhD student in the School of Life Sciences Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) program. The program emphasizes learning to give oral presentations in conference and interview settings, and we practice this at our weekly colloquium held in the Biodesign auditorium. Attending this conference and presenting my work will allow me to continue developing my speaking skills and give me practice presenting in a more organic setting. It will also give me an opportunity to speak to an audience that is unfamiliar with my work. % talk about networking, informally speaking about my work, working on concise, understandable introductions (elevator speech)

Attending the conference will also help me meet my professional goals.
